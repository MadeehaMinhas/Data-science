The following steps need to be followed to execute the code:
1. Execute the "Dataset_labelling_and_merging.ipynb" file in Google Colab by uploading the zip data folder named "CSV files.tar.gz" in Google Colab local storage. The execution of the code will provide a combined data file named "Combined_IoT_profiling_dataset_2022.csv". 
2. Then execute the "train_test_split.ipynb" file in Google Colab by uploading the combined data file "Combined_IoT_profiling_dataset_2022.csv" obtained from Step 1. Execution of this code will provide train and test set files named "Combined_IoT_profiling_dataset_2022_train_set.csv" and "Combined_IoT_profiling_dataset_2022_test_set.csv" respectively.
3. Execute the "Class based data split.ipynb" file by uploading "Combined_IoT_profiling_dataset_2022_train_set.csv" file obtained in Step 2. Execution of this code will provide separate data files for each class named 'IoT_audio.csv', 'IoT_home_automation.csv', and 'IoT_camera.csv' respectively.
4. Execute the "GANS(DP).ipynb" and "GANS(without_dp).ipynb" files on each of the three files obtained in Step 3 separately and save the synthetic data files with appropriate names. (e.g. save them as ''synthetic_IoT_home_automation.csv', ''synthetic_IoT_camera.csv', and ''synthetic_IoT_audio.csv')
5. Execute the "ML_model(original).ipynb" by uploading 'Combined_IoT_profiling_dataset_2022_train_set.csv' and 'Combined_IoT_profiling_dataset_2022_test_set.csv' data files.
6. Execute the "ML_model(synthetic).ipynb" by uploading the synthetic data files for each class (e.g. 'synthetic_IoT_home_automation.csv', 'synthetic_IoT_camera.csv', and 'synthetic_IoT_audio.csv'). Also, upload the original test set file named 'Combined_IoT_profiling_dataset_2022_test_set.csv'. Make sure to execute this file twice for synthetic data produced by GANS with DP and that produced by GANS without DP. Upload respective synthetic data files in the code and change file names accordingly.
7. Execute "MIA (original).ipynb" by uploading 'Combined_IoT_profiling_dataset_2022_train_set.csv' and 'Combined_IoT_profiling_dataset_2022_test_set.csv' as input data files on Google Colab.
8. Execute "MIA(synthetic).ipynb" on synthetic data files by uploading the respective synthetic data files from each class  (e.g. 'synthetic_IoT_home_automation.csv', 'synthetic_IoT_camera.csv', and 'synthetic_IoT_audio.csv') and original data files named as 'Combined_IoT_profiling_dataset_2022_train_set.csv' and 'Combined_IoT_profiling_dataset_2022_test_set.csv' on Google Colab. Make sure to execute this file twice for synthetic data produced by GANS with DP and that produced by GANS without DP. Upload respective synthetic data files in the code and change file names accordingly.
